            Hello! I'm a passionate <strong>Front-End Developer</strong> with a strong foundation in web technologies and a creative eye for design.
            I recently completed a <strong>Front-End Development Diploma</strong> from <em>Bravo Company</em>, where I built real-world projects using
            <strong> HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery,</strong> and <strong>React</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            My journey into web development started from a deep curiosity about how websites work. What began as a hobby quickly turned into a professional path.
            I enjoy turning complex problems into clean, user-friendly interfaces.
          </p>

          <p>ðŸ’¡ <strong>What sets me apart:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>I care deeply about <strong>responsive design, performance,</strong> and <strong>clean code</strong>.</li>
            <li>I'm always learning and improving to stay ahead in the ever-evolving world of front-end development.</li>
            <li>I believe in continuous growth, collaboration, and delivering meaningful user experiences.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Whether it's building landing pages, interactive components, or full-scale web apps, I take pride in crafting digital experiences that make an impact.
